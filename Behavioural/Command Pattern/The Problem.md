## Here is a scenario.

Let's assume that we wanna make a GUI framework. We'll create a `button` class/component so the others can use it. But we dont't know what the user wants with this button. When clicked, s/he may want a form to be posted, or the database to be upadated. We cannot hardcode the functionality inside the button class as it depends on what the user wants.

### What can we do now?
